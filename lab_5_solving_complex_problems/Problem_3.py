Design and implement a program that allows the user to play a version of Nim against the
computer.  Nim is a mathematical strategy game, which dates to 16th century China.  There
are many variations on this game, but the version weâ€™ll be playing starts with a row of
11 sticks. On their turn a player may remove 1, 2, or 3 sticks from the pile. Players
alternate taking turns, and the play removing the last stick wins.

First, your program should print out a welcome statement and brief instructions. Then, you
should display the current game state and prompt the player for the number of sticks they
want to remove. After making sure they entered a valid response, you should remove the appropriate
number of sticks. If there are now zero sticks remaining, you should declare that player the
winner and end the program. Otherwise, the computer should take a turn. The computer should randomly
choose the number of sticks to remove.  Here's a sample of what your output might look like:
